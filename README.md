# Modern-Portfolio-Optimization-using-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning
## Overview

This project explores **portfolio optimization** by combining classical financial theory with modern computational approaches. It evaluates both **traditional models** (e.g., Equal-Weighted, Maximum Sharpe, Minimum Volatility, CAPM, Fama-French) and **AI/ML-based strategies** (PCA, Hierarchical Risk Parity, Reinforcement Learning) to improve portfolio construction and risk management.

The goal is to provide a framework for **adaptive, data-driven asset allocation** that can balance risk and return in dynamic financial markets.

## Key Features

* Implementation of **classical optimization strategies**:

  * Equal-Weighted (NaÃ¯ve) Portfolio
  * Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
  * Minimum Volatility Portfolio

* **Statistical & Factor Models**:

  * Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
  * Fama-French Three-Factor Model

* **AI/ML-based approaches**:

  * **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€“ dimensionality reduction for eigen-portfolios
  * **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)** â€“ tree-based clustering for robust diversification
  * **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** â€“ dynamic rebalancing using reward-driven learning

* **Monte Carlo Simulations** to visualize portfolio feasibility space and the Efficient Frontier

* **Empirical Testing**:

  * Applied to the **Magnificent Seven (MAG7)** tech stocks
  * Extended to the **Dow Jones 30 (DJ30)** for broader market coverage
  * Trained on data from 2021-2023 market data and back tested on data from 2024 market data

## Results Summary

* **Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio** delivered the strongest returns but carried higher volatility.
* **Minimum Volatility Portfolio** offered consistent risk reduction, suited for conservative investors.
* **PCA-based portfolios** concentrated in TSLA and NVDA, capturing market variance effectively.
* **HRP** provided balanced allocations across DJ30, reducing concentration risk.
* **RL models** demonstrated adaptability to changing market conditions.
